# Ferroboo-s_Journey - The Metallurgy Adventure Game

Ferroboo is a game designed for my **metallurgy project**, where players guide an ingot named **Ferroboo** through various heat treatment processes to enhance its properties and battle powerful metal bosses. The game simulates real-world metallurgy concepts such as quenching, tempering, and annealing to influence Ferroboo’s strength, toughness, and ductility.

## 🔥 Gameplay Overview

- Ferroboo starts with balanced properties: **hardness, toughness, ductility, and health**.
- Players can **quench, temper, or anneal** Ferroboo to modify its properties.
- The goal is to **prepare Ferroboo for battles** against metal bosses like Iron Crusher, Steel Knight, and the Adamantine Annihilator.
- Each boss has different hardness and toughness stats, requiring strategic heat treatments to win.

## 🎮 How to Play

### 1️⃣ Install Requirements

Make sure you have **Python 3** installed along with the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Game

```bash
python ferroboo.py
```

### 3️⃣ Game Controls

- **Quenching**: Increases hardness but reduces toughness and ductility.
- **Tempering**: Balances hardness and toughness.
- **Annealing**: Increases toughness and ductility but reduces hardness.
- **Battle**: Engage in fights with bosses using Ferroboo’s current stats.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- More bosses with different metal properties
- Special attacks based on heat treatment history
- Interactive animations for battle sequences

## 📜 Credits

Developed as part of my **metallurgy project**, exploring the effects of heat treatment on mechanical properties.

Enjoy the game and refine Ferroboo into the ultimate metallurgical warrior! ⚔️🔥
